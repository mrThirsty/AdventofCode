# Advent of Code

This will contain all my attempts at the Advent of Code puzzles. There will be a folder per year with a single solution per year and a Project per day. I will try to leave all my code in so that both daily puzzles solutions are available.

## Warning
This code works on my machine and I don't claim it will work or not break your machine. I am also not looking for the most elegant solutions just ones I could code in the time constraints I have for the day and gives me the answer to the puzzles.

## Contributing
While I don't want people contributing answers to puzzles I haven't yet done. If you feel you can refactor my code for the better then please go ahead and raise a pull request.
